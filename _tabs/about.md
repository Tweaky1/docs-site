## Who Am I
![Headshot](/assets/img/posts/BuryJ-139.jpg){: width="491" height="500" .w-50 .shadow .right}
Hello my name is John Bury and currently I am an Intern at Nokia. I fell in love with technology at a very young age beginning with an intense passion for video games. I enjoyed the challenge they posed along with the competition it fueled between myself, friends, and family. That passion quickly turned into the question of, "How does this all work?" Along with that question I became interested in my Dad's work, as he was always working with computers and the things he would do fascinated me. Over time my interest in game development has gone away and turned to computers in general.

I soon learned how to pick compatible parts and build my own computer (initially for playing games) and after that experience I began enveloping myself in all things technology. I started learning about networking, basic computer science topics, coding, and a little about security. Saving the long winded story, that brings us to today. I'm currently completing my Bachelor's in Information Technology online, and I've earned the CompTIA Network+, Security+, Cloud+, and the LPI Linux Essentials certification. 

## This Site
The primary use of this site will be to document the technologies, services, and applications I use within my homelab. This serves as a reminder to myself how my homelab is configured and short tutorials that will hopefully help anyone else interested in hosting the same services. That first computer I built has become the testing ground for everything I do within my homelab, lovingly called my Shit Box. I first used it as a way to learn the processes involved with installing and managing a Linux server. From there the basics of Docker and Docker Compose along with creating and running my own systemd services. This website you are connected to is running through a Docker container on that computer. I have since added a Raspberry Pi to the mix to run PiHole DNS and a few other minor services. I have run into a few issues with PiHole as I don't have the control necessary over my ISP provided router. I will iron those out soon and document the process here. In the future I also plan to host a Jellyfin media server, and a few other services, all of which will be documented.
